                    My name is Mulu Chekol from Addis Abeba, Ethiopia. I was born in 1955 with many siblings. I am Ethiopian and I have 5 own biological children. They all are adults now. I have been called ‚Äômother‚Äô by many other children too that I have had a chance to meet and get to know. I used to have my own business with my husband running a restaurant and a shop. I love my country and people from the bottom of my heart. I can see suffering every day and that is touching my heart and I am trying to do my best to help people who are the most vulnerable ones. That is why I want to help especially poor children and women. I think this is the very good sustainable development. I have worked with poor and needy people since 1998. But what makes me do this voluntary work? Let me tell you my story.

                    I believe that we all have a purpose and a special calling for our lives to make this world better place to live by helping, loving, caring and sharing. I also think that if you really listen to your heart and inner self, you will also find it, if not yet. I have seen miracles to happen in my life and in many people¬¥s lives too. Why do I believe so? I am Christian and I trust that God is leading us to reach others, because God Himself is Love. God changed my life for good when I finally said ‚ÄôYes‚Äô to Jesus and accepted Him into my life in 1991. After that decision to follow my heart and God¬¥s plan, I literally lost everything, except Jesus, who was with me faithfully. So it was not easy for me at all. First of all my husband wanted me to get out from my own house. I had to leave my children, husband, house and job, but God had a big picture of my life and a surprising road to walk with Him. God was teaching me through hunger, suffering, being homeless without my dear family and any money. God is a good teacher. Now I know it. I had lots of questions for God. Why? I wanted to be with my children, but I could not. My family thought that I changed my religion, but I only received Jesus in my life which means that I have a personal relationship with Him and I can talk with Him all the time. He is the one that has always stood and been there for me after all difficulties.
                    My totally new life continued and I saw so many poor and sick people in the streets crying and begging without clothes, God changed my thinking. Before that I didn¬¥t see or I didn¬¥t care about poor people and their pain. God opened my eyes and I started to see people around me. My heart cried especially for poor women and children. First I started to pray that God would send some rich people to help them, not me, but God had another plan. He did not answer my prayers in a way I expected. He is a wise teacher. He wanted me to show His love for them and help them. I didn¬¥t have anything to give. God told me: Give your love! Give yourself!‚Äù As God has Himself loved us first And His love is beyond our understanding!
                    God gave me love (‚ÄôFikir‚Äô in Amharic language) for people to practice His love through me. He wanted to teach and test me. I saw one old man sitting on the street. He was dirty and smelly. God told me to wash him. I was shocked. It was not easy task for me and I was afraid. How can I was a man? In our culture it is impossible. But I obeyed the gentle inner voice that spoke to me. Everyone could see me washing him and they knew I was not his relative. He was touched by this kindness. He had been living in the street for many years. He was hiding himself and never seen the kindness from anyone. God gave me a gift of love: His love through me pouring into others and I only see people as beautiful and precious as God sees them. I was amazed as well. When I was serving and washing him, I did not smell anything. Naturally I can smell everything, but when I am working, I lose my sense of smell, so I can serve people. It happens with everyone I serve. I thank God for this gift.
