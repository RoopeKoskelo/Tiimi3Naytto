                    My name is Mulu Chekol from Addis Abeba, Ethiopia. I was born in 1955 with many siblings. I am Ethiopian and I have 5 own biological children. They all are adults now. I have been called ’mother’ by many other children too that I have had a chance to meet and get to know. I used to have my own business with my husband running a restaurant and a shop. I love my country and people from the bottom of my heart. I can see suffering every day and that is touching my heart and I am trying to do my best to help people who are the most vulnerable ones. That is why I want to help especially poor children and women. I think this is the very good sustainable development. I have worked with poor and needy people since 1998. But what makes me do this voluntary work? Let me tell you my story.

                    I believe that we all have a purpose and a special calling for our lives to make this world better place to live by helping, loving, caring and sharing. I also think that if you really listen to your heart and inner self, you will also find it, if not yet. I have seen miracles to happen in my life and in many people´s lives too. Why do I believe so? I am Christian and I trust that God is leading us to reach others, because God Himself is Love. God changed my life for good when I finally said ’Yes’ to Jesus and accepted Him into my life in 1991. After that decision to follow my heart and God´s plan, I literally lost everything, except Jesus, who was with me faithfully. So it was not easy for me at all. First of all my husband wanted me to get out from my own house. I had to leave my children, husband, house and job, but God had a big picture of my life and a surprising road to walk with Him. God was teaching me through hunger, suffering, being homeless without my dear family and any money. God is a good teacher. Now I know it. I had lots of questions for God. Why? I wanted to be with my children, but I could not. My family thought that I changed my religion, but I only received Jesus in my life which means that I have a personal relationship with Him and I can talk with Him all the time. He is the one that has always stood and been there for me after all difficulties.
                    My totally new life continued and I saw so many poor and sick people in the streets crying and begging without clothes, God changed my thinking. Before that I didn´t see or I didn´t care about poor people and their pain. God opened my eyes and I started to see people around me. My heart cried especially for poor women and children. First I started to pray that God would send some rich people to help them, not me, but God had another plan. He did not answer my prayers in a way I expected. He is a wise teacher. He wanted me to show His love for them and help them. I didn´t have anything to give. God told me: Give your love! Give yourself!” As God has Himself loved us first And His love is beyond our understanding!
                    God gave me love (’Fikir’ in Amharic language) for people to practice His love through me. He wanted to teach and test me. I saw one old man sitting on the street. He was dirty and smelly. God told me to wash him. I was shocked. It was not easy task for me and I was afraid. How can I was a man? In our culture it is impossible. But I obeyed the gentle inner voice that spoke to me. Everyone could see me washing him and they knew I was not his relative. He was touched by this kindness. He had been living in the street for many years. He was hiding himself and never seen the kindness from anyone. God gave me a gift of love: His love through me pouring into others and I only see people as beautiful and precious as God sees them. I was amazed as well. When I was serving and washing him, I did not smell anything. Naturally I can smell everything, but when I am working, I lose my sense of smell, so I can serve people. It happens with everyone I serve. I thank God for this gift.

                Later God wanted me to eat with beggars on the street. Before I received Jesus into my life as my Saviour, I did not want to see or touch beggars. I was too proud and blind for their situation. One day I saw one woman with five children living on the streets. One child, called Etaferaw, about 10 years old, was silent and did not beg like her other sisters. So I asked her mother about her. Mother told me, that she doesn’t speak or see and she doesn’t know anything because of her mind. God loved that poor girl and wanted to have better life for her. I asked her mother, if I can take care of her. She was happy to give her child away, because she thought that she cannot beg for her and it was easier to get rid of her. So I took her to my sister´s house, where I was living. Etaferaw has been living with me now for the last ten years. I don’t have much to give her, except my love. We pray together and see little miracles happen every day! Now she goes to government school, which is free to her. She can speak, hear, see, help in the housework etc. She loves to pray and sing. Now she is helping us with children in a day nursery. She is like my own daughter.

                What happened to my own children that I had to leave? I took some years, before I got my children back. They also share my vision! God answered my prayers again!
                How it all started in the very beginning? I heard HIV/AIDS radio-program. Kerttu, a missionary worker from Finland, was telling about her work with HIV-positive women. She told about the love that can change lives! It encouraged me do something too. I started to have prayer meetings with my friends. Later on I had a chance to meet Kerttu and these HIV-positive women. I learned a lot about love. I was amazed how much she had been giving her time for people who were suffering and people that others turned their back to these poor young women. I thought, if God has sent somebody from foreign country to help our people, I must do the same! I decided to obey God fully, whatever He wants me to do for His people.
                I started my work from my neighbours. It was not easy, because they thought that I have lots of money. Also my own relatives thought I was mad! Why do you suffer and help poor neighbours, when you don’t have anything for yourself? This was the question I often heard. But I have God and God is rich, I answered! He has all. He knows exactly what He does and who are needy. I don’t know. In Ethiopia, there are lots of poor people and lots of problems. God always sends me to the broken hearts and helpless people in right time. God puts some people in my heart and touch my heart deeply. Then when I see the problem of those people, I am always surprised about God´s love and care for those helpless people that no one else seems to see, nor care.

                I have shared my vision with some people, and they have continued sharing it with other people telling about how lives can change, not only physically, but mentally, touching their souls. This is the way to let real stories to be told as an encouragement. It is never too late to help someone around us, even with just little things, like smiling, noticing and giving some time. I have felt the pain of these people of feeling being totally invisible to others. Now I have many friends who know about this work and want to help the way they can. Some teach the children, some help by giving clothes, some have built mud houses, some give the money for medicine, school fees, house rents, food, milk etc. Friends give what they have; time, money, support or knowledge. During these many years we have been able to help more than 200 people. At the moment we are helping about 100 women and children. God has been faithful and He loves every single individual with the same amount of love. When I started this voluntary work, I was alone. But thank God, I have received a lot of good friends via the work and I can count on them and God that He can bring more people with good heart! Giving is receiving!
